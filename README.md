************

The reason for this app is to create a budget tracker.  The user is able to input information in the amount and type, and it will graph how much money you have spent.

    Dependencies
      -compression
      -express

*****

I was able to get the app working to the point where everything online worked.  But I was not able to get the offline function to work.  

I was able to get the entire app up and running with help from my tutor.

*****

The application is now fully able to take in information online and save it offline and then be able to pull it back once you go online again.

It has been submitted to Heroku and is now fully functional.
