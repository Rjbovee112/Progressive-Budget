## PROBLEMS 

I was able to get the app working to the point where everything online worked.  But I was not able to get the offline function to work. Everything would stay on the page, track the inputs and show the graph, but once I went offline then back online nothing would show up. 

With the help of my tutor I was able to connect the online and off line functions, so that when you go offline the information is stored and returned when you go back online.

## READY TO RUN

The application is now fully able to take in information online, save it offline and be able to input back into the graph once you back online.

It has been submitted to Heroku and is now fully functional.

This project was created by Robert Bovee with the help of a tutor to connect the online/offline function.

Although I had trouble creating this project, using webpack and Lighthouse was fun to see.  Used on a much larger application, the use of those items, webpack, compression and so one is a must to keep the website fast and responsive.
